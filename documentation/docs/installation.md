The library is still under development,create issues [here](https://github.com/Groww/viserion/issues/new)
:::

```bash
yarn add viserion
or
npm install viserion
```

## Requirements

This library depends on some third party library like [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) , [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/#installation) & [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/getting_started)

If you are at **_>0.60_** react-native versions then you don't need to link these libraries or if you are at below to this version you would need to link it manually these libraries into your project.

```bash
react-native link <package-name>
```
