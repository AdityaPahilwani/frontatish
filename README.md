# Installation

Follow this [link](https://groww.github.io/frontatish/docs/getting-started) to setup frontatish into you project.

> The library is still under development & we are working to ship more usefull components very soon,below are some components which seems stable to use for now.

# Requirements

Few of our components depends on external libraries to perform well,for example [Checkbox](https://groww.github.io/frontatish/docs/checkbox),it depends on [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) to render icons inside the box,similarly [Button](https://groww.github.io/frontatish/docs/button) uses [react-native-material-ripple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-material-ripple) so before using these components you should install along with the `frontatish` installation

so please make sure you already have this package installed and linked properly to you react-native project.

We assume it best perform on `react-native` greater than `v0.60`,we have not tested below to that version,if you are on lower versions of react and facing any issue,you can file and issue [here](https://github.com/Groww/frontatish/issues/new)
